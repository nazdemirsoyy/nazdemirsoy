As a System Analyst at ExxonMobil, I led the development of an internal product using the OutSystems platform, a low-code solution that enables rapid and agile delivery. I integrated emerging business requirements to optimize product functionality, and actively engaged with end-users to collate feedback, driving continuous product improvements based on their insights. I strategically planned and prioritized product releases to align with organizational goals and user demands.

I am a fresh Computer Science graduate from Eotvos Lorand University (ELTE), where I deepened my knowledge and skills in web development, data science, and artificial intelligence. I have completed multiple certifications in these domains, demonstrating my passion and commitment to learning and innovation. I have also gained hands-on experience in data solutions and server management in ExxonMobil Hungary, where I oversaw server monitoring and maintenance, and leveraged my development expertise to craft an automation tool, enhancing server monitoring efficiency. I am eager to apply my technical and analytical abilities to solve complex problems and create value for businesses and society.
